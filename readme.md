# Hackers Poulette

Project solo in PHP.

The main goal is to create a contact form that displays multiples informations. Those informations must be retrieve and to be sent on an PHPMailer like.

While the user is allowed to enter differents informations about theim, it also needs to be validate and sanitize.

Therefore, one of the instruction requiere the form to display a message alerting if any of the information needed is missing or incorrect.
